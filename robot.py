GOALS:
    - Have an easily customizable autonomous mode that can take vector inputs and do those movements
        -- python GUI app that outputs vector data and autonomous "map" into a csv
        -- autonomous reads a csv
        -- Figure out how to actually go an exact distance without guessing & checking times
    - Working swerve drive
    - Configuration file (preferabbly json) for most if not all robot settings
    - Communicate with vision using networktables
    - Get motor framework down (assume we are using talonfx controllers)
